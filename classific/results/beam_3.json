Your task is to classify the outcome of a potential web attack based on a given HTTP request (`req`) and HTTP response (`rsp`).\nThe classification categories are: SUCCESS, FAILURE, or UNKNOWN.\n\n**Classification Definitions:**\n\n*   **SUCCESS**:\n    *   The `req` contains evident attack payloads.\n    *   The `rsp` clearly shows the attack was executed AND the attacker's objective was achieved. Examples include:\n        *   Direct output of an executed command (e.g., directory listing, file content, system information).\n        *   Leakage of sensitive data that was the target of the attack.\n        *   Confirmation messages or response content indicating a successful data manipulation, file operation, or state change caused by the payload.\n        *   The presence of content or artifacts that confirm the payload's impact (e.g., uploaded files, modified resources) even if not explicitly stated.\n\n*   **FAILURE**:\n    *   The `req` contains evident attack payloads.\n    *   The `rsp` clearly indicates the attack was blocked, failed, or did not achieve its objective. This includes:\n        *   Explicit error messages indicating command failure, invalid input, access denial, or payload rejection.\n        *   HTTP status codes (e.g., 403, 404, 500, 300, or 410) where the response body or context confirms the payload was specifically blocked, or an unhandled error prevented execution.\n        *   Redirections to error pages, login forms, or untrusted endpoints that suggest the malicious request was denied.\n        *   No observable impact, or sanitized/escaped reflection of the payload, when the payload would typically produce specific output or effects if successful.\n        *   Responses that do not confirm or deny the payload's execution but indicate the system acted as if the attack was blocked (e.g., redirecting to a login page, returning unrelated content, or resetting sessions).\n        *   Response content that implies the attack was unsuccessful (e.g., \"invalid command,\" \"resource not found,\" \"access denied\") even if the HTTP status is not explicitly an error.\n\n*   **UNKNOWN**:\n    *   It cannot be determined with reasonable certainty if the `req` contains attack payloads.\n    *   **OR**\n    *   The `req` contains evident attack payloads, BUT the `rsp` does not clearly indicate success or failure. This includes scenarios where:\n        *   The `rsp` content is empty or contains only generic, non-specific acknowledgments (e.g., \"start,\" \"ok,\" \"processed\") **without any accompanying data, logs, or observable effects** that confirm the payload's impact or lack thereof.\n        *   The `rsp` returns a generic web page (e.g., the site's homepage, a standard product page, a default error page) that doesn't reflect any outcome of the payload.\n        *   The attack involves non-echoing commands or actions (e.g., reverse shells, blind SQLi, file download/upload commands where the response doesn't confirm the file transfer status or content), **and the response provides no useful feedback** on the outcome.\n        *   The `rsp` acknowledges a parameter used in the payload but does not confirm the achievement of the attacker's ultimate goal (e.g., a webshell is uploaded, but the response doesn't show it executing commands).\n        *   The `rsp` is in an unknown or unparseable format, contains no useful information regarding the payload's execution, or returns unknown/ambiguous errors that do not clarify the payload's impact.\n\n**Clarification of Key Boundaries:**\n\n- If the `rsp` is empty or contains no observable impact, the outcome should be **UNKNOWN**, not **SUCCESS**, unless there is clear evidence (e.g., uploaded files) of the payload's execution.\n- If the `rsp` indicates the attack was blocked (e.g., 403, 404, redirection to an error page, or 300 response), it should be classified as **FAILURE**, even if the `rsp` contains no explicit error message.\n- If the `rsp` is a success code (e.g., 200 OK), but no evidence of payload execution is visible and the response provides no useful feedback, the outcome should be **UNKNOWN**, not **SUCCESS**, unless there is direct evidence of impact (e.g., file upload, system command execution).\n- If the `rsp` includes generic or non-specific acknowledgments (e.g., \"success\", \"processed\") without additional context or observable effects, it should be classified as **UNKNOWN**, as it does not confirm or deny the payload's impact.\n- If the `rsp` is a 500 Internal Server Error or similar, **do not automatically classify it as FAILURE** unless the error message or context clearly indicates the payload caused the error. If the error is system-wide or unrelated to the payload, it should be classified as **UNKNOWN**.\n\nAnalyze the following `req` and `rsp`:\n\n[REQ START]\n{req_data}\n[REQ END]\n\n[RSP START]\n{rsp_data}\n[RSP END]\n\nBased on the definitions and the provided req/rsp, classify the outcome as SUCCESS, FAILURE, or UNKNOWN.\nYour output should be ONLY one of these three words: SUCCESS, FAILURE, or UNKNOWN.\n\nClassification:\n```"
