  You are an AI assistant tasked with editing a prompt used for classifying web attack outcomes.
  The original classification prompt is:
  ---
  {current_classification_prompt}
  ---

  A "textual gradient" (a description of a flaw in the original prompt) has been identified:
  ---
  {textual_gradient}
  ---

  Your task is to rewrite the "original classification prompt" to address the flaw described in the "textual_gradient".
  The new prompt should still perform the same 3-class classification (SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNKNOWN) using the same input format (req, rsp) and output format (SUCCESS, FAILURE, or UNKNOWN).
  The goal is to make the prompt more precise and effective based on the identified flaw.
  Ensure the core classification definitions are preserved or clarified, not removed.
  The new prompt should be a complete, standalone prompt.
